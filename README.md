# 📈 Robustness Analysis of Pareto-based Joint Evaluation of Fairness and Relevance in Recommender Systems ⚖

This repository contains the code for the _extra_ experiments and analyses in our work on "Robustness Analysis of Pareto-based Joint Evaluation of Fairness and Relevance in Recommender Systems", which is currently under review (single-anonymous).

This work extends the WWW'25 full paper "Joint Evaluation of Fairness and Relevance in Recommender Systems with Pareto Frontier" by Theresia Veronika Rampisela, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Maria Maistro, and Christina Lioma. The code for the original experiments is available [here](https://github.com/theresiavr/DPFR-recsys-evaluation).
